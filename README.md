# eden-xi-teleport
For players on the Eden XI private server, create a ticket and I will come back from AFK and grant you Teleport-{Location}. Creating an issue pushes a notification to my phone. Use /tell to let me know who you are. 

Reward appreciated.

# how to use
Create an [Issue](https://github.com/AndrewDiMola/eden-xi-teleport/issues) within this repo, using the following template:

## How do I know if you're accepting requests?
I'm available for teleport requests whenever Issues is open to create a ticket. Whenever I'm not around, or not planning on fielding requests, Issues will be disabled for this repo.

## Can I have Teleport-Yhoat, Altep, or Vahzl?
**TL;DR:** Soon! I have the scrolls for Yhoat and Altep and am close to WHM 38. 

Vahzl will take some more time though. 

## Where are you in game?
`/sea zhadn`
